In this project, we create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, we populate our colony with the bravest ants we can muster. Our ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade our territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and our queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.
